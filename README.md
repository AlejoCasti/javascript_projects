## Rock, Paper, or Scissors
Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.
This program creates a random choice of the computer to play with the user. The code where the user's choice should change is at the end of the file.
